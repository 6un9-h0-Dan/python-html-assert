[Clean Code]
 - Is element def the right name? And are we confusing this with the concept of matchers?

[Logging]
  - Show path to failing matcher when printing results
  - Add hints to the result on how to look for the problem
     - If failed matcher not matching anything, then that's the problem
     - If failed matcher does match something, then structure likely issue

[Parsing]
  - Fix the recursive matcher
  - Allow users to select which matcher to use

[Specification]
  - Separate out bootstrap specific helpers into a separate module

[Testing]
  - Write tests for the formatters

[Utils]
  - Mixin for test cases to expose a normal style assert method
